# Exam1-Java

Why are we doing this? 

I believe we are doing this for many reasons, mainly to help us embed the concepts which we have learned but not really put into practice. This will also allow the people running the course to track our progress to adjust support required.

How I expected the challenge to go. 

I knew the challenge would be very difficult, while i understand the individual concepts covered in the past few weeks I had no experience of exploring them in depth by putting them into practice, I was also very worried about trying to get the frontend and backend to communicate as initially i found this hard to visualise how this would work.

What went well? 

I am really please that i have been able to implement working CRUD functionality to my application, It was a great deal of work as i worked late into friday and spent most of saturday trying to make progress. I feel way more confident about using javascript in a practical way now, i think that before this project i thought i fully understoof everything but it wasn't until i experimented with everything and experienced plently of errors that i actually learned what each bit of code is doing. I think now my knowledge of the tools used it much stronger.

What didn't go as planned? 

There were plenty of times when i spent hours stuck on a problem and tried finding solutions online which came to no avail. I found it extremely frustrating to put hours of hard work in while making little to no progress as this was discouraging.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 

I think that we would have been better prepared for this project if we had done more small exercises on the individual concepts covered in the past few weeks that actually challenged us to think about how the code was working. For example the fetch API exercises on community was basically an exercise in copying and pasting and didnt take much brain power to complete, if we had been set a challenge that was more difficult I would have had a better understanding of one of the key components required for this challenge.
